 If I play the following 12800 long sample on
GB sound channel 3...

SineWaveSample:
        REPT    400
        DB      $8b,$df,$ff,$db,$84,$20,$00,$24
        DB      $8b,$df,$ff,$db,$84,$20,$00,$24
        ENDR

 ... then I get the results that are shown in this 'gbsnd3.gif'.

 As can be seen from the gif, the top sine wave appears
relatively normal but the lower wave has a weighted appearance
depending on the sample values.

 The top wave has a small noise spike after reloading of wave
RAM is complete but the bottom wave has a very large spike.
This spike accounts for the very heavy buzz sound heard in
these samples.

 During the 'sample reload period' when snd chnl 3 is disabled
the effective value being output is 7 1/2.

 Also notice that the very first sample is identical to the last
COMPLETE sample that was output before snd chnl 3 was turned off
for reload.

 Due to these artifacts there is a tremendous amount of distortion
on the sound playback on older GB full-size models and a smaller
amount (but still significant) in all late model older full-size GBs,
GB Pockets, and GB Colors units.

 It appears to me that snd chnl 3 was never designed for dynamic
reload/updates in order to play raw audio samples due to the
side-effects of doing that are described above.
